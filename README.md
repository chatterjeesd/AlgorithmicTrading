# AlgorithmicTrading
These are the eariest versions of python programs that I wrote to automate my trades. This was when I was just starting out in this field.
The main idea was to automate the entire process starting from login to my broker's terminal to firing orders to squaring off positions
after trade hours. Now I use different programs to trade which are obviously not on Github and use Quantopian to backtest my ideas.
