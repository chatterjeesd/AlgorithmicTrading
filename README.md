# AlgorithmicTrading
These are the earliest version of python programs that I wrote to automate my trades. This was when I was just starting out in this field.
The main idea was to automate the entire process starting from login to my broker's terminal using webscraping to firing orders to squaring off positions after trade hours using python and RESTful APIs. Now I use different programs to trade which are obviously not on Github and use Quantopian to backtest my ideas.
